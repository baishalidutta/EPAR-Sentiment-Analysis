# EPAR Sentiment Analysis Data Source

The dataset cannot be provided since I don't have the copyright
for it.

But, you still can provide any XLSX dataset containing the following columns:

* `ID`
* `Sentence`
* `Positive`
* `Negative`
* `Neutral`

The `ID` is the index column and the `Positive`, `Negative` and `Neutral` columns
are one-hot encoded, that is, for every row, one of these columns contains `1` whereas 
the others contain `0`.
